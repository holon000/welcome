                A password manager improves your security and eases your life. With just one password you can generate unlimited random passwords for every account you use and also keep track of all your passwords in one place, across devices and browsers. Easy.
                To get you started here is the extension download link for  [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd) and  [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/)
                After you installed the extension watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rZkAZWjvmI)  for a quick explanation on how to setup your account.

                Before we start, in case you don’t have already a 2FA app installed we recommend to install Authy app from the [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8).

                ### Securing your Google account with Authy

                1. Click `Switch to app`
