            | First timer? No worries, the guide below should get you up and running in no time. Reach a snag?
            a(href='https://ethereum.slack.com/messages/general') Let us know how to improve it.

      h2 Step One: Google Apps
      ul
        li
          a(href='http://mail.ethereum.org', target='_blank') Mail
          | ,
          a(href='http://calendar.ethereum.org', target='_blank') Calendar
          | ,
          a(href='http://docs.google.com', target='_blank') Docs
        li
          | Username:
          code &lt;firstname.lastname&gt;@ethereum.org
        li
          | Password:
          code &lt;supplied to you&gt;
      p
        | After you’re done, you can
        a(href='https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?authuser=1&amp;rd=1') sync your account
        | in your preferred desktop or mobile client.
      h2 Step Two: WorkingOn
      p
        a(href='https://www.workingon.co/') Create an account
        | with your
        code @ethereum.org
        | email &amp; all your updates will automagically be posted to slack in the
        a(href='https://ethereum.slack.com/messages/workingon') #workingon
        | channel. Each morning a summary email will be sent out with the prior day’s activities… and if you forgot to mention anything, just reply with those items.
      p
        | In fact, you can also keep WorkingOn updated while on-the-go by sending an email to
        a(href='mailto:today@m.workingon.co') today@m.workingon.co
        | from your
        code @ethereum.org
        | email. Put one task per line, like this:
        pre
          | checking out the WorkingOn tools
          | testing the email tool
          | installing some of the other tools
          | -
          | Mihai

      p
        | The important thing is to
        strong try and make a habit of writing short updates
        | to keep the entire team in sync. This tool is tremendously useful for everyone to stay in sync but only works if we all use it :)
      h2 Step Three: Slack
      p
        a(href='https://ethereum.slack.com/signup') Slack
        | is our primary communication and sharing tool. It integrates with WorkingOn, GitHub, and
        a(href='https://ethereum.slack.com/services/2261375141') Google Drive
        | . They've also got mobile clients for
        a(href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8') iPhone
        | and
        a(href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack') Android
        | .
      p
        | The next thing is to look for the ethereum #channels relevant to your interests and domain(s) of activity and join in. If you have any questions please check the Questions tab. See you in
