              First timer? No worries, the guide below should get you up and running in no time. Reach a snag? [Let us know how to improve it.](https://ethereum.slack.com/messages/general)

      h2 Step One: Google Apps
      ul
        li
          :markdown
            [Mail](http://mail.ethereum.org), [Calendar](http://calendar.ethereum.org), [Docs](http://docs.google.com)

        li Username: `&lt;firstname.lastname&gt;@ethereum.org`
        li Password: `&lt;supplied to you&gt;`

      p After you’re done, you can [sync your account](https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?authuser=1&amp;rd=1) in your preferred desktop or mobile client.
      h2 Step Two: WorkingOn
      :markdown
        [Create an account](https://www.workingon.co/) with your `@ethereum.org` email & all your updates will
        automagically be posted to slack in the [#workingon](https://ethereum.slack.com/messages/workingon) channel.
        Each morning a summary email will be sent out with the prior day’s activities... and if you forgot to mention anything, just reply with those items.

        In fact, you can also keep WorkingOn updated while on-the-go by sending an email to [today@m.workingon.co](mailto:today@m.workingon.co)
        from your `@ethereum.org` email. Put one task per line, like this:
        ```
        checking out the WorkingOn tools
        testing the email tool
        installing some of the other tools
        -
        Mihai
        ```

        The important thing is to **try and make a habit of writing short updates** to keep the entire team in sync. This tool is tremendously useful for everyone to stay in sync but only works if we all use it :)

      h2 Step Three: Slack
      :markdown
        [Slack](https://ethereum.slack.com/signup) is our primary communication and sharing tool.
        It integrates with WorkingOn, GitHub, and [Google Drive](https://ethereum.slack.com/services/2261375141).
        They've also got mobile clients for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8)
        and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack).

        The next thing is to look for the ethereum #channels relevant to your interests and domain(s) of activity and join in.
